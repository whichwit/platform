# The WORKSPACE file tells Bazel that this directory is a "workspace", which is like a project root.
# The content of this file specifies all the external dependencies Bazel needs to perform a build.

####################################
# ESModule imports (and TypeScript imports) can be absolute starting with the workspace name.
# The name of the workspace should match the npm package where we publish, so that these
# imports also make sense when referencing the published package.
